# Data Playground (COVID-19)

A full stack application to visualize and understand COVID data.

## Why

This project was created in 2020 to encourage people to investigate facts for themselves.

Always ask: Where did these numbers come from? Were they calculated? How do I know they're reliable? What are the margins of error? Is there associated errata? Are these numbers reproducible (for scientific data)? How can I validate this information? Is it scientifically and mathematically accurate? Are there multiple datasets available measuring the same events from different points of view, from which a comparison can be made?

## Requirements

You must have `Docker` installed and a terminal on your computer to run commands in.

## Run
